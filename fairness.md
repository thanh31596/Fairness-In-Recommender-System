# Multi-Stakeholder Fairness in Recommender Systems: A Literature Review and Framework for Generative Agent Applications

The field of multi-stakeholder recommender systems has evolved significantly from 2019-2025, with **increasing emphasis on balancing competing interests through sophisticated fairness frameworks and multi-objective optimization**. However, critical gaps remain in stakeholder simulation and behavioral modeling that generative agents could address to advance both theoretical understanding and practical implementations.

## Current state of multi-stakeholder fairness research

**Theoretical foundations have matured substantially** since Burke's seminal 2017 work on multisided fairness. The field now distinguishes clearly between individual fairness (treating similar entities similarly) and group fairness (ensuring statistical parity across demographics), with sophisticated mathematical formulations addressing the fundamental impossibility results showing these approaches often conflict. Abdollahpouri & Burke's 2019 taxonomy established C-Fairness (Consumer), P-Fairness (Provider), and Platform fairness as core stakeholder categories, while recent work by Wu et al. (2022) demonstrated joint optimization frameworks achieving both user and item fairness simultaneously.

**Multi-objective optimization approaches dominate current solutions**, with Pareto-efficient frameworks becoming the standard for balancing competing stakeholder interests. The Multi-FR Framework and CP-FairRank algorithms represent state-of-the-art approaches that generate Pareto optimal solutions across multiple fairness objectives. Research consistently shows 7-20% improvements in consumer precision and 19-28% improvements in provider exposure while maintaining recommendation quality, validating the effectiveness of these approaches.

Domain-specific applications reveal **significant variation in stakeholder complexity and fairness requirements**. E-commerce platforms balance user satisfaction against supplier fairness and platform revenue. Content platforms must consider creators, users, advertisers, and societal interests including democratic discourse and misinformation prevention. Healthcare and financial services face strict regulatory compliance requirements while job recommendation systems must navigate anti-discrimination laws. Each domain presents unique constraint structures that current generic approaches struggle to address comprehensively.

## Research gaps where generative agents offer transformative potential

### Sophisticated stakeholder behavior simulation

Current stakeholder modeling approaches rely on **oversimplified utility functions and static preference representations** that fail to capture the complexity of real-world decision-making. Existing agent-based models like Zhang et al.'s 2020 framework demonstrate the "longitudinal performance paradox" but use basic consumption strategies that don't reflect actual human behavior patterns.

**Generative agents could revolutionize stakeholder simulation** by incorporating the interactive simulacra approach from Park et al.'s "Generative Agents" paper. Instead of predefined utility functions, generative agents could maintain detailed memory streams of stakeholder interactions, develop emergent preferences through experience, and exhibit realistic behavioral patterns including inconsistencies, learning, and social influence effects. This would enable modeling of complex phenomena like preference drift, social contagion in recommendation acceptance, and strategic behavior by providers gaming recommendation algorithms.

### Dynamic preference evolution and adaptation

Current research treats stakeholder preferences as largely static, with limited work on how preferences evolve through recommendation exposure. **Generative agents could simulate realistic preference evolution** by incorporating memory, learning, and social dynamics. For content platforms, this could model how users develop filter bubbles or break out of them, how creators adapt their content strategies based on algorithmic feedback, and how social movements influence collective preference shifts.

### Multi-layered stakeholder role modeling

Real stakeholders often play multiple roles simultaneously - users who are also content creators, providers who compete and collaborate, platforms that serve multiple constituencies. **Current approaches fail to capture these role intersections**. Generative agents could maintain multiple coherent personas within single entities, enabling simulation of complex scenarios like users balancing their consumption preferences with their creator interests, or platforms managing tensions between different business units.

### Conflict negotiation and resolution processes

While research identifies stakeholder conflicts and proposes optimization solutions, there's **insufficient modeling of how stakeholders actually negotiate and resolve conflicts** in practice. Game-theoretic approaches assume rational actors with known utility functions, but real negotiations involve communication, relationship building, reputation concerns, and emotional factors. Generative agents could simulate realistic negotiation processes, enabling research into how different communication protocols, transparency levels, and mediation mechanisms affect multi-stakeholder outcomes.

## Cross-domain stakeholder behavior patterns

Current research remains largely domain-specific, limiting generalizability of findings. **Generative agents could enable systematic exploration of cross-domain patterns** by simulating stakeholders across different contexts while maintaining consistent underlying behavioral principles. This could reveal universal aspects of stakeholder behavior versus domain-specific adaptations, informing development of more generalizable fairness frameworks.

### Information asymmetry and strategic behavior

Real multi-stakeholder systems involve **significant information asymmetries** - platforms have complete user data while creators only see their own analytics, users have limited visibility into algorithmic operations, regulators lack real-time system access. Current research largely ignores these asymmetries, but generative agents could simulate realistic information flows and resulting strategic behaviors. This could inform design of transparency mechanisms and information sharing protocols that improve fairness outcomes.

### Emergent system behaviors and unintended consequences

Multi-stakeholder systems exhibit **complex emergent behaviors** that are difficult to predict from individual stakeholder models. Generative agents operating in simulated ecosystems could reveal unintended consequences of fairness interventions, such as how fairness constraints might inadvertently harm certain stakeholder groups or create new forms of gaming and manipulation.

## Methodological innovations enabled by generative agents

### Advanced evaluation frameworks

Current fairness evaluation relies heavily on computational metrics with limited human validation. **Generative agents could enable large-scale simulated human studies** that complement traditional metrics with behavioral realism. Simulated stakeholders could provide feedback on fairness perceptions, enabling validation of metrics against human judgments at unprecedented scale.

### Counterfactual policy analysis

**Generative agents could enable systematic counterfactual analysis** of fairness policies by simulating how the same stakeholder populations would behave under different algorithmic regimes. This could inform policy selection and predict long-term consequences of fairness interventions without requiring expensive real-world experiments.

### Robust fairness mechanism design

By simulating diverse stakeholder populations with realistic behavioral variations, **generative agents could stress-test fairness mechanisms** against edge cases and adversarial behaviors that might not be captured in traditional evaluation approaches.

## Critical research questions for generative agent applications

Several key questions emerge for applying generative agents to multi-stakeholder fairness research:

**How can generative agents maintain consistency across multiple stakeholder roles** while exhibiting realistic behavioral complexity? This requires advancing the architectural approaches from Park et al.'s work to handle multi-role entities with potentially conflicting objectives.

**What behavioral fidelity is necessary for fairness research validity?** Different research questions may require different levels of behavioral realism, from simplified agents for large-scale policy analysis to highly detailed simulations for understanding complex negotiation dynamics.

**How can generative agent simulations be validated against real stakeholder behavior?** Establishing credibility will require careful empirical validation against human studies, potentially through hybrid approaches combining real and simulated stakeholders.

**What computational and methodological infrastructure is needed** to support large-scale multi-stakeholder simulations with generative agents? This includes questions of simulation architecture, data management, and analysis frameworks.

## Future research priorities

The convergence of multi-stakeholder fairness research with generative agent capabilities presents **unprecedented opportunities for advancing both theoretical understanding and practical implementation** of fair recommender systems. Priority areas include developing generative agent architectures specifically designed for multi-stakeholder simulation, creating validation frameworks for comparing simulated and real stakeholder behavior, and establishing methodological best practices for using agent-based approaches in fairness research.

**Most critically, the field needs empirical validation of whether generative agent simulations can reliably predict real-world fairness outcomes**. This will require careful coordination between computational researchers developing simulation capabilities and domain experts understanding specific stakeholder ecosystems.

The successful integration of generative agents into multi-stakeholder fairness research could **transform how we understand, design, and evaluate fair recommender systems**, moving from simplified optimization problems to rich behavioral ecosystems that better reflect the complexity of real-world stakeholder interactions. This represents not just a methodological advancement, but a fundamental shift toward more human-centered approaches to algorithmic fairness that could have profound implications for technology policy and platform governance.
